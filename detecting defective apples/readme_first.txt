The corresponding paper for the code is "Detection of Defective Apples using Learnable Residual Multi-Head Attention Networks integrated with CNNs."

The main_code.py file primarily implements the model for detecting defective apples. Due to the large size of the dataset, only a portion of the sets are provided in the apple_data folder. If the complete dataset is required, please contact the author for access.
